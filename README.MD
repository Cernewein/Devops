# Devops & Software engineering

I use this repository to host the notes I am writing along my learning journey on the foundations of devops.

This repository is inspired by [90DaysOfDevops](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps). In the same spirit I will split up the information into more digestible smaller pieces, although they might not correspond to a day's worth of material.

This repository will not be exhaustive, but will cover the parts that I feel I have the most to learn about, and might even extend outside of pure devops engineering.
